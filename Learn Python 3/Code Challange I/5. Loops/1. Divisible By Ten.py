"""
Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers 
are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of 
numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in 
the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and 
the final count will be returned. These are the steps we need to complete this:

	1.	Define the function to accept one input parameter called nums

	2.	Initialize a counter to 0

	3.	Loop through every number in nums

	4.	Within the loop, if any of the numbers are divisible by 10, increment our 
		counter

	5.	Return the final counter value

#Write your function here
def divisible_by_ten(nums):
	count = 0
	for number in nums:
		if (number % 10 == 0):
			count += 1
	return count
#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))
